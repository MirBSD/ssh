This release of OpenSSH is for MirBSD systems.

• Due to legal reasons (lack of licence or being covered by patents) or
  unavailability in the system crypto library (NSA-influenced), no ECC
  is contained in this release. This affects ECDSA as well as *25519.

• Any “sk” (U2F/FIDO security keys) use ECC and are thus not supported.

• Some code for OpenBSD features not yet available in MirBSD, such as
  the pledge sandbox, has been removed or disabled, so using this on
  OpenBSD probably isn’t a good idea.

if you want to install OpenSSH on other operating systems.

To extract and install this release on your OpenBSD system use:

OpenSSH is a derivative of the original and free ssh 1.2.12 release
by Tatu Ylonen.  Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck, Markus Friedl, Niels
Provos, Theo de Raadt and Dug Song removed many bugs, re-added newer
features and created OpenSSH.  Markus Friedl contributed the support
for SSH protocol versions 1.5 and 2.0.
